// NOTES:
// SERVER:
// Try to see if you can avoid using Ip's for communication to the peers.
// If the peers only use communication with names, it is more secure and anonymous.

// 1. Server should not display messages only made out of white spaces.
// 2. Refactor the server code part. Refactor client with tui-rs.
// 3. If a user connects and there are not available names left, send it a PM before its connection is closed or something.
